so this is me doing a little vibe coding with a little triming to get this up and running, but basiclly this is me being lazy with deck building. for some context i play a digitl card game called shadowverse WB. there are many play styles and decks but i play a deck type called aybss craft and what this script does is go onto youtube and looks up some of the best deck video showcases. then saves them to a json file format. it notes the video name, the views, the video url. its also meant to make a copy of the deck list but that isnt there yet. i will keep working on this to ge this fixed also. 

but that being said even if you done use this thanks for reading and have a great day
